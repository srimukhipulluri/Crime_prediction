# Crime Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict crime hotspots and types of criminal activities based on historical crime data. The solution leverages various machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights for law enforcement agencies.

## Project Structure

- **`accuracy.txt`**: Contains the accuracy of the trained model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for running the application.
- **`upload.csv`**: Dataset used for training the model.
- **`app.py`**: Python script containing the machine learning model and application logic.
- **`model.pkl`**: Serialized file of the trained model, ready for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
